# Welcome! 欢迎！
Thanks for visiting my profile.

Here you can find a limited selection of projects I've been working on in recent years. Be aware that most of my projects are experimental and might unexpectedly receive breaking changes or are discontinued.

My current programming language of choice is Go, though I'm also proficient in C, C++, Java, JavaScript, Python and Swift. Furthermore I've experience with IEC 61131-3 languages for PLC programming and functional programming with Haskell.

My working language is English (both British and American), please use it when contacting me. I also have varying proficiency in German, French, Chinese (Mandarin/汉语) and Japanese.

In case you want to hire me, please note I'm not interested in doing consulting. I've a preference for long-term opportunities in Asia-Pacific or North America.
