# Welcome!
Thanks for visiting my profile.

Here you can find a limited selection of private and university projects I've been working on from 2019 to 2023. Currently, I'm not actively using this account.

Please note, this is only the tip of the iceberg of my contributions. The majority of projects I am or was involved in is either closed-source or hosted on other source code management plaatforms.
